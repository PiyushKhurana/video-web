            <h3>Upload: üìÇ</h3>
<ul>
<li>A User can upload video in any format.</li>

<li>Since video uploading takes time the webapp will display percentage of file uploaded and actual file size uploaded in megaBytes (MB) along with a nice progressbar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Watch:üéûÔ∏è</h3>

A User can watch the uploaded videos in three formats
<ul>
<li>The original format <em><strong>(Not all video formats are supported by browsers)</strong></em></li>‚ùå
<li>webm</li>
<li>gif</li>
</ul>
<h3>Edit: ‚úÇÔ∏è</h3>

After uploading the video , a user can also edit it. Following editing functionalities are provided:-
<ul>
<li>Text Watermark: A user can add a watermark to the video.</li>
<li>Rotate: A user can rotate the video in three ways:
90¬∞ ClockWise
90¬∞ AntiClockWise
180¬∞</li>
</ul>
üõë <em>Note: Modifications will be done only to the original format of video , due to limited cpu resources.
</em> </p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced üôá</h2>
<p>First Challenge I encounter was , the request timeout problem which was arising when I was doing processing just after uploading the video only. Similarly I was editing the video just after user submits the edit request . As processing takes time , the server could not give successful response within a stipulated time and it was often causing request timeout errors . I got to know this problem while I was trying to deploy on heroku where request timeout value is 30 sec and it is fixed , it can't be changed ‚ùó </p>

<p><em>How I solved: ‚úÖ Just when I was going through the heroku docs for changing the request timeout value , from there I came to know the concept of cron jobs which are similar to background processes and they can be configured to run periodically after certain time intervals. So I implemented this technique and created cron jobs which were php scripts only , each for post video uploading task and editing video task.</em></p>

<p>Since I was processing videos in the background , I need to have a queueing system which will ensure that the video which gets uploaded first , or the video which gets request for edit first , will be processed first and also the videos which are supposed to be processed will only get processed , as not all videos require processing all the time . Since no external libraries can be used I have to think of a different approach ‚ùó</p>

<p><em>How I solved: ‚úÖ Since I was already using database for storing file paths of video , I tried to implement a queue kind of functionality using database by using some special fields inside the table. Following are the fields and their significance :-</em></p>

<p><ul><li><strong>isProcessed :</strong> To check whether video has been processed or not just after the upload. By default it is set to 0 , which means every video requires processing after upload. When the processing is done it is set to 1 indicating that it has done the mandatory after upload processing.</li>
<li><strong>created :</strong> It is timestamp which is used to take decision of which file to be processed first , in case if there are many videos that requires processing.</li>
<li> <strong>isModified :</strong> To check whether a video is requested for change. By default it is set to 0 which means no modifications require . When user initiates a request for edit , it's value is set to 1 indicating that there are some modifications to be done in this video .</li>
<li><strong> updated :</strong> Similar to created timestamp , it is used to take decision of , in which file modifications to be done first , in case if there are many videos that requires modification.</li></ul></p>
<p>Since there was a video editing functionality present in the webapp , each time when a video was edited , it's file name didn't changed . Since the file name was same , the file paths also remain the same , so google chrome was loading the file from its local cache only thinking that the file is same . So the modified video was not visible until I reopen the webapp in new tab or restart the browser ‚ùó</p>

<p><em>How I solved: ‚úÖ While going through various stackoverflow discussions , I find a effective solution that will work irrespective of the browser and their caching methods. The idea was to add a query string with a timestamp value (Here I am using a random number instead of timestamp) to the source of video element , which will tricked the browser thinking that the video source has been changed , so it will load the video from server not from its local cache.</em></p>
